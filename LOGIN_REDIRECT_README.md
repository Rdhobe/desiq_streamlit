# Login & Register Auto-Redirect

## Implementation Details

We've implemented automatic redirection for authenticated users who attempt to access the login or register pages. This implementation has two layers:

### 1. Server-Side Redirection
- Modified the `login_view` and `register_view` functions in `core/views.py`
- Added a check at the beginning of both views to detect if the user is already authenticated
- If authenticated, the user is immediately redirected to the dashboard

```python
def login_view(request):
    # Redirect authenticated users to dashboard
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        return redirect('core:dashboard')
    # Rest of the login logic...
```

### 2. Client-Side Fallback
- Added JavaScript to both the login and register templates
- JavaScript checks for authentication indicators in the DOM or session cookies
- If authentication is detected, the user is redirected to the dashboard
- This serves as a fallback in case the server-side redirect fails (e.g., due to page caching)

```javascript
// Check if user is authenticated by checking for user-specific elements
const isAuthenticated = document.querySelector('.sidebar') !== null || 
                        document.querySelector('.user-nav') !== null || 
                        document.cookie.includes('sessionid=');

// Redirect to dashboard if already authenticated
if (isAuthenticated) {
    window.location.href = "{% url 'core:dashboard' %}";
}
```

## Benefits

- Improves user experience by preventing authenticated users from seeing login/register pages
- Follows security best practices by reducing potential attack surface
- Provides a double-check mechanism using both server-side and client-side validation
