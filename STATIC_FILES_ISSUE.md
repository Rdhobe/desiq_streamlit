# Static Files Issue Resolution

## Problem: 404 Error for script.js

The application was experiencing a 404 error for the file `/static/js/script.js`. This error occurred because:

1. The base template files (`base.html` and `base_no_login.html`) were including a script file:
   ```html
   <script src="{% static 'js/script.js' %}"></script>
   ```

2. However, this file did not exist in the project's static files directory.

## Solution

We resolved this issue by:

1. Creating the missing `script.js` file in the `core/static/js/` directory with basic functionality:
   - Tooltip initialization
   - Dropdown menu functionality
   - Modal dialog support
   - Form validation
   - Notification management

2. Adding corresponding CSS styles to `style.css` to support these JavaScript features

## Files Modified

- Created: `core/static/js/script.js`
- Updated: `core/static/css/style.css`

## Benefits

- Fixed the 404 error that was appearing in the browser console
- Added useful UI components that can be used throughout the application
- Improved form validation and user feedback
- Added support for modals, dropdowns, and tooltips to enhance the UI

## Next Steps

To make further use of the new JavaScript functionality:

1. Use data attributes to activate the features:
   - `data-tooltip="Tooltip text"` for tooltips
   - `data-modal-target="modalId"` for modal triggers
   - `data-validate` on forms for validation

2. Add the appropriate HTML structure for modals:
   ```html
   <div id="modalId" class="modal">
     <div class="modal-dialog">
       <div class="modal-content">
         <div class="modal-header">
           <h5 class="modal-title">Modal Title</h5>
           <button type="button" class="modal-close" data-modal-close>&times;</button>
         </div>
         <div class="modal-body">
           <!-- Modal content here -->
         </div>
         <div class="modal-footer">
           <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-modal-close>Close</button>
           <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button>
         </div>
       </div>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

3. Use the notification system for alerts:
   ```html
   <div class="notification success">
     <div>Operation completed successfully!</div>
     <span class="dismiss">&times;</span>
   </div>
   ```
